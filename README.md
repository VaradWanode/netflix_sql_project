# Netflix Business Analysis using SQL

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s content catalog using SQL to extract meaningful business insights.
The objective is to answer practical, decision-oriented questions related to content distribution, genres, countries, release trends, and ratings — similar to what a data analyst or business analyst would do in a real-world scenario.

The analysis is designed to be **simple, structured, and business-focused**, avoiding unnecessary complexity while still demonstrating strong SQL fundamentals.
